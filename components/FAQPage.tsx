            <AccordionItem question="What is The Gem Project Sanctuary?">
                <p>The Gem Project Sanctuary is a nonprofit organisation just outside Cape Town that provides adoption, healing and lifelong care for dogs and horses in need. We help animals who have been abandoned, neglected or mistreated find new beginnings through rehoming or, where needed, lifelong sanctuary. Many of those we help are the unwanted  the ones overlooked, surrendered or forgotten. Some are adopted into loving homes. Others stay with us when their medical or emotional needs are too great. Every animal is given the chance to recover and thrive.</p>
                <p>Our name reflects our purpose. We find the overlooked gems  often hidden beneath trauma or fear  and help them shine again through patient, compassionate care.</p>

            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem question="What is your mission and vision?">
                 <p>We envision a world where every dog and horse knows safety, comfort and belonging.</p>  
                 <p>Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome animals in need while also providing lifelong care to those who cannot be adopted. We build meaningful partnerships and create a culture of compassion through adoption, sanctuary and community engagement.</p>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem question="How is a sanctuary different from a shelter?">
                <p>Unlike traditional shelters, we commit to animals for life. While we do rehome many animals, others remain with us permanently due to age, medical needs or trauma. We are their forever home when no other is possible.</p>
            </AccordionItem>
             <AccordionItem question="What makes you different from other sanctuaries or rescues?">
                <p>We provide both longterm sanctuary and a thoughtful adoption process. Every animal lives in a homelike setting. Dogs stay in familystyle units and enjoy daily walks, enrichment and outings. Horses roam open paddocks and receive consistent loving care.</p>

Caregivers form deep bonds through regular visits, feeding, grooming and companionship. It is perfect for those who want meaningful connection without fulltime responsibility. Caregivers are honoured as part of each animalâ€™s extended family.</p>
