                        <li><strong>Submit an Application:</strong> Let us know about your lifestyle, experience and what you are looking for.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chat with Our Team:</strong> We'll get in touch to recommend dogs that may be a good fit for you.</li>

                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">We do things differently. Our dogs live in family-style units, not in kennels. They receive daily enrichment, personalised training and consistent care. We get to know them deeplyâ€”their quirks, their joys and their ideal home environment.</p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">By adopting from us, you are not just saving a life. You are joining a journey of love and transformation.</p>

                        <li>Every dog receives comprehensive veterinary checks, vaccinations, and sterilisation.</li>
                        <li>Behavioural and training support is provided before and after adoption.</li>
                        <li>We offer ongoing guidance to help the transition go smoothly.</li>
                        <li>You can meet and get to know the dog before making a decision.</li>

                    <p className="mt-6 text-base italic text-gray-500">Please note: While we remain available to offer guidance and advice after adoption, any ongoing behavioural or training services required would need to be arranged and funded independently.</p>
